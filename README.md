# AssignmentDataCourseProject

1. The first part of the script deals with downloading the data and unziping the file
2. On the second part I rename the variables in order to make the merging more easy
3. Then I proceed to merge the data and create a new data set##
4. after that I Extract  only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement using select function from dplyr
5. In the next part I use merge to match the descriptive activity to the names of the activities in the data set
6. Then I rename the column variables in my data set##
7 Finally I created a new data set with the average of each measurment in the data set


All Acc in columnâ€™s name replaced by Accelerometer

 Gyro variable was replaced by gyroscope
 BodyBody variable name was replaced by body
 Mag was replaced by Magnitude
 the t word was replaced with time 
 the f word in variable was replaced by frequency
 

Frome the Features_info.txt

arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
